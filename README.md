3. Write your answers to non-coding questions in this file (`README.md`).

## Tips

1. CS3217's Gitbook is at https://www.gitbook.com/book/cs3217/problem-sets/details. Do visit the Gitbook often, as it contains all things relevant to CS3217. You can also ask questions related to CS3217 there.
2. Take a look at `.gitignore`. It contains rules that ignores the changes in certain files when committing an Xcode project to revision control. (This is taken from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Swift.gitignore).
3. A Swiftlint configuration file is provided for you. It is recommended for you to use Swiftlint and follow this configuration. Keep in mind that, ultimately, this tool is only a guideline; some exceptions may be made as long as code quality is not compromised.
4. Do not burn out. Have fun!
